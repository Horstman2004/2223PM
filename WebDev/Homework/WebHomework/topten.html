                <td>Ball State</td>
                <td>Has a meteorology degree. Always been interested in atmospheric science so this would be one of my top picks. It’s also recognized by the NWS for reaching all their standards. Closer to an actual NWS office. Allows for more interaction in the field that I want to go into. Host field meteorology. Difference between broadcast and field is that you're actually out analyzing data in a field, broadcast you are on a tv in everyone’s household. Has options for Computer Science as well. Fact: Computer Science is my first option.</td>

                <td>Similar to Ball State as far as accreditation goes. Has a very good program for broadcast meteorology. Bit farther away than I’d like to be but still a viable option in my book.</td>

                <td>Western Kentucky University</td>
                <td>Same as ball state, bigger campus, more of a party school. Not my top pick for what I want to do but overall still a great college for atmospheric sciences. In state tuition as well. Has a great field meteorology program. School is a lot closer to the NWS office that hosts the quad states region including us. Computer Science classes are small which is good. A big class isn’t always the best.</td>
